Last Updated: 7:24 PM 1/19/2014

What you need:
----------------------------------------------------
- cpbo installed*
- A text editor (Notepad++ is recommended).
- Access to your dayz_server.pbo.
- A downloaded copy of DZAI

* cpbo can be downloaded as part of the Arma Tools package here: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411

Before you begin:
----------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported issues connecting to their server after unpacking and repacking their dayz_server.pbo. 
If this happens to you, follow the installation instructions using PBO Manager instead. You will also need to download and install PBO Manager. Note that you must start again with a fresh, working dayz_server.pbo.


Basic Installation Guide (with cpbo):
----------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack your dayz_server.pbo. Right click dayz_server.pbo and click "Extract".
2. Copy the downloaded DZAI folder inside your unpacked dayz_server folder.
3. Inside the unpacked dayz_server folder, locate server_monitor.sqf in dayz_server\system\. Edit server_monitor.sqf with a text editor.
4. Inside server_monitor.sqf, search for the line that says:

		allowConnection = true;

	Change the line to this:

		[] call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZAI\init\dzai_initserver.sqf";
		allowConnection = true;
	
5. Optionally, you may edit DZAI's settings in DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf
6. Repack your dayz_server.pbo by right-clicking the unpacked folder, then click on "create PBO". If prompted to overwrite, click "Yes".


Troubleshooting: A number of users have reported issues with entering the game after repacking their dayz_server.pbo. 
If you encounter this problem, copy the $PBOPREFIX$ file inside the 'extras' folder and paste it inside the dayz_server folder and then repack it into pbo format. This should fix the connection problems.

Note 1: Editing the server_cleanup.fsm is not required for AI vehicle patrols from DZAI version 1.8.0 onwards.
