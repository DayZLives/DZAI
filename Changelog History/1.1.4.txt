1.1.4 Update:

- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers now despawn after 120 seconds if all players have left the trigger area, or after 300 seconds after all spawned AI units have been killed (previously, timer was 120 seconds for both conditions).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger intersection warnings now appear in the RPT log if DZAI_debugLevel is set to 1 or higher. (Note: After 3 attempts, triggers are placed on the map regardless of whether or not there is overlapping with other triggers).
- [MODIFIED] Chernarus: dynamic trigger area reduced from 6000m radius to 5500m, max. triggers reduced to 15 from 16, and trigger moved slightly NW to avoid coastal areas.
