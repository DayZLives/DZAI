DZAI 2.1.3 Changelog

[NEW] Death messages for killing AI units. Requires DZAI client addon to be installed. Only player who killed the AI unit will receive the message. If the player is inside a vehicle, all players inside the vehicle will receive the message.
[CHANGED] Changed DZAI client addon file structure to be more similar to DZAI server package. All configuration options are now located in dzai_client_config.sqf
[CHANGED] Zeds will only be alerted by AI gunfire if they are more than 10 m away. (If DZAI_weaponNoise is enabled)
[CHANGED] Classname-checking now also verifies scope. (Base-classes are no longer allowable).
[CHANGED] AI infantry units now spawn facing a random direction.
[CHANGED] AI anti-stuck detection is now more aggressive for AI groups that have been found to be stuck in their patrol paths.
[CHANGED] Simplified DayZ mod autodetection to an on/off configuration option. Fully manual classname definitions using dzai_config.sqf can now be set by setting DZAI_modAutoDetect to false.
[CHANGED] Greatly streamlined file organization structure in world_classname_configs folder.
[CHANGED] Moved DZAI_customSpawnsReady flag variable away from custom spawn definitions file to avoid accidental user deletion of the flag variable.
[CHANGED] Added a small grace period of zero dynamic spawn probability following a successful dynamic AI spawn. (10% of DZAI_maxSpawnTime).
[CHANGED] Fixed nearby building detection for auto static spawn generation for unsupported maps.
