1.1.12 Update:

- [NEW] AI units can now be stunned with Tasers. (DZAI will detect if Double Doppler's Taser Mod is installed).
- [UPDATED] DZAI now automatically detects the presence of certain DayZ mods and enables extra settings. Automatically detected mods: DayZ 2017, Namalsk 2017, DayZ Epoch, DayZ Overwatch. NOTE: DayZ Civilian requires manual editing in dzai_variables.sqf to enable extra features.
- [UPDATED] Removed setting to enable extra features for DayZ Lingor (Skaronator version) since it should be fully supported without user intervention.
