1.2.2 Update:

- [FIXED] AI self-healing now heals damage properly.
- [REMOVED] Removed all AI skin loot and related loot tables. (Use Remove Clothes addon instead)
- [REMOVED] Removed auto-detection for DayZ 2017 and Namalsk 2017 due to possibility of future false-positive detections. All 2017 mods now require manual activation in dzai_variables.sqf.
- [UPDATED] Added probability checks for adding medical and edible loot. Default settings: 75%/medical, 85%/edible.
- [UPDATED] Setting debugMarkers = 2 will enable debug markers for static triggers and allow continuous refreshing of dynamic trigger locations. (Setting value to 1 will disable these markers but other debug marker functionalities remain).
- [MODIFIED] Increased AI helicopter crew skills.
- [MODIFIED] Increased AI health. Note: Due to the differences between how AI and player health is calculated, AI units may be more or less durable than player units.
- [MODIFIED] Chernarus: Shifted Stary Sobor AI patrol further away from military tents as AI units can see through the tent walls.
- [MODIFIED] Chernarus: Changed Stary Sobor AI spawns from 1 min + 3 additional max to 2 min + 2 additional max.
- [MODIFIED] Changed activation delays for all static triggers to 10/15/20 seconds.
