1.1.7 Update:

- [FIXED] Fixed cause of null groups being created (again).
- [UPDATED] spawnBandits/spawnBandits_dynamic now handles spawn point calculations, fn_createGroups/fn_createGroups_dyn handles group creation and trigger variable initialization, and fn_createUnit handles creation of individual AI units.
- [UPDATED] For static triggers instructed to spawn multiple groups, each individual group's size may now vary instead of being a simple duplicate of the first group.
- [REMOVED] Removed DZAI_spawnExtra variable.
