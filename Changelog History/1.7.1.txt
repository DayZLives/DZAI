DZAI 1.7.1 Changelog:
============

- [NEW] Added "passive zed aggro" option. With this enabled, zombies will tend to loiter towards the nearest AI group leader if there is one nearby (within 75m). Enable by setting DZAI_passiveAggro = true in dzai_config.sqf. Default setting is false (disabled).
- [NEW] AI spawned from static triggers in large cities (100 or more lootable buildings within 250m) will now patrol randomly between buildings instead of patrolling in a circular pattern.
- [NEW] Added a test version of the reworked dynamic AI spawn system. This new dynamic spawn system randomly selects online players and spawns dynamic triggers directly on their position, rather than randomly distributing triggers around the map. More info here: http://opendayz.net/threads/release-dzai-lite-dynamic-ai-package.11116/page-27#post-78863. (Enable the test version by setting DZAI_V2dynSpawns = true).
- [NEW] Free-for-all mode for all AI units. If enabled, all AI groups will be hostile to each other, but AI in the same group will not be hostile to each other. Note: FFA mode will not include AI units spawned using the custom spawn function (DZAI_spawn) and does not include AI helicopters. Custom-spawn AI and helicopter AI will be hostile to static and dynamic AI and vice-versa.
- [FIXED] Static triggers will now search for up to 150 buildings capable of spawning loot/zombies within a 250m radius rather than the nearest buildings.
- [FIXED] AI air vehicles will generate loot if destroyed by players using vehicle weapons. Note: Vehicles with multiple gunners such as helicopters may have issues with this.
- [FIXED] Fixed issue with AI helicopter spawning script that some users were experiencing.
- [UPDATED] Updated zed aggro script to a simplified DayZ 1.8.x version.
- [UPDATED] Radio text messages can now be disabled in dzai_config.sqf by setting DZAI_radioMsgs = false. Default setting is true (enabled).
- [UPDATED] Dynamic AI will now use trigger position as patrol center point if player logs out or is killed during pursuit state.
- [UPDATED] Cause of death text for Study Body action on AI units is now randomized between blood loss and head shot.
- [CHANGED] AI-to-AI friendly fire damage reduced by 80% (same as collision damage reduction).
- [CHANGED] Dynamic AI patrol radius decreased from 250m to 225m.
- [CHANGED] AI unconsciousness time increased from 10 to 12.5 seconds.
- [CHANGED] General increase in MilitarySpecial/HeliCrash weapon probability.
- [CHANGED] Added separate weapongrade probabilities for AI helicopter crew. AI helicopters now have the best chance of generating MilitarySpecial/HeliCrash loot.
- [CHANGED] Slight reduction in base AI aiming speed rating values.
- [CHANGED] AI helicopter wreck cleanup delay increased from 10 to 15 minutes.
- [CHANGED] Chernarus: Further reductions and changes in AI spawns at NWAF. Spawns around the airfield have a reduced equipType value (should allow slightly easier entry to the airfield).
- [CHANGED] Chernarus: Northmost NWAF static spawn location shifted towards the industrial hangars.
- [CHANGED] If an AI unit is killed by another AI unit, all magazines on the victim are removed.
- [CHANGED] AI killer-hunting behavior and dynamic AI player-seeking behavior now continues even if the player gets on a bicycle or motorcycle.
- [CHANGED] Weapongrade value can now be explicitly defined when using the DZAI_spawn custom spawn function (instead of specifying equipType). This value will determine which DayZ loot table to generate AI weapons from. More information can be found in the custom_spawns config files.
- [CHANGED] Custom spawn function will now generate AI spawn points on-the-fly instead of generating a set of predetermined spawn points.
- [CHANGED] Custom spawns can now have respawn disabled. If the entire AI group is killed, the spawn trigger will self-delete. If the spawn area is despawned and some units have survived, the number of surviving AI units is saved.
- [CHANGED] Radio text messages now have a 0.5 second fade-in time.
- [CHANGED] The format for calling the custom spawn function (DZAI_spawn) has changed. To see the updated format, see this link: http://opendayz.net/threads/release-dzai-lite-dynamic-ai-package.11116/page-28#post-79148.
- [CHANGED] AI health increased very slightly.
- [CHANGED] Reduced probability of generating pistol weapon instead of rifle for AI with weapongrade 0 from 55% to 45%.
- [REMOVED] Removed Rocket_DZ and Survivor3_DZ skins from DZAI Epoch config file.
