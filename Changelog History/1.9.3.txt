- 1.9.3 Update:

	
    [NEW] Added option to use clientside method of displaying radio text messages.
        To enable, set "DZAI_useRadioAddon = true" in dzai_config.sqf
        Enabling this requires the DZAI client add-on to be installed into your mission pbo and the following inserted into your mission init.sqf:
        Code:

        _nul = [] execVM "DZAI_Client/dzai_initclient.sqf";

        If DZAI_useRadioAddon is enabled, radio text messages will be repeated on player's screen 3 times within 3 seconds.
        If DZAI_useRadioAddon is disabled, the radio messages will be transmitted by the normal remote execution method,
    [CHANGED] Several changes to AI patrolling behavior
        AI with patrol radius less than 75m will patrol walking instead of running.
        AI with patrol radius less than 100m will not search for nearby loot piles.
        AI with patrol radius less than 100m will tend to linger at each patrol waypoint for a longer amount of time
    [CHANGED] AI headshots with sufficient damage are now autokills (similar to players).
    [CHANGED] Lowered AI aimingShake and aimingSpeed values for weapongrade 0 units.
    [CHANGED] Adjusted dynamic spawn cycle frequency:
        Old frequency: 5-8 minutes per cycle
        New frequency: 5-9 minutes per cycle
        Previous time required to reach maximum % spawn probability (per person): 15-24 minutes.
        New time required to reach maximum % spawn probability (per person): 20-36 minutes.
    [CHANGED] Epoch: Increased blacklist radius of each trader area to 300m from 200m.
