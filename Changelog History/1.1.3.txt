1.1.3 Update:

- [UPDATED] fnc_spawnBandits and fnc_spawnBandits_dynamic are now "spawned" instead of "called", and handles preparatory calculations before spawning AI units. IMPORTANT: If using custom static triggers, please make this update. (call fnc_spawnBandits >> call fnc_spawnBandits)
- [UPDATED] AI group creation is now handled by fnc_createGroups (static triggers) and fnc_createGroups_dyn (dynamic triggers). Individual AI units are created by fn_createUnit. This script is shared by fnc_createGroups and fnc_createGroups_dyn.
- [UPDATED] Updated preset default classname tables to DayZ 1.7.7.1 version.
- [MODIFIED] AI units revert to an "AWARE" state from "COMBAT" after pursuit state ends if DZAI_findKiller is enabled. If not enabled, AI will remain in "COMBAT" mode until the entire group is killed (this is intended).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers no longer activate for players in Air vehicles. Note: Trigger will activate if players exit the air vehicle, but will not deactivate if players re-enter. AI stop actively tracking targeted player's position but will continue to the last known position.
