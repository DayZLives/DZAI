1.4.4 Update:

- [FIXED] Fixed bug where debug markers for dynamic triggers became desynchronized with their assigned trigger.
- [FIXED] Dynamic AI player-seeking now uses AI group leader as center point for AI patrol if target player logs out during pursuit state.
- [FIXED] Waypoints are no longer created for a wiped-out dynamic AI group.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered AI aimingAccuracy for all skill tiers. Large increases to AI aimingShake (lock-on time decrease) and smaller increases to AI aimingSpeed. These changes are intended to increase AI effectiveness in close quarters and decrease effectiveness at long distances.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered collision damage reduction for AI from 90% to 80%.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered probability of generating pistol instead of rifle for weapongrade 0 AI units from 66% to 55%.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic AI spawn distance from target player modified from 200m-300m to 200m-250m.
