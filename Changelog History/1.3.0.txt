1.3.0 Update:

- [NEW] Unconsciousness for AI units: AI units can now be temporarily knocked unconscious when shot. Damage threshold to knock out an AI unit is identical to player units. Unconsciousness time is currently fixed at 10 seconds. (Note: Helicopter AI units cannot be knocked unconscious).
- [NEW] Added support for DayZ Hunting Grounds. Includes new AI skin models and backpacks.
- [NEW] Server admins can now store their custom settings in DZAI\DZAI_settings_override.sqf for reuse. Copy over the settings from DZAI\init\dzai_variables.sqf that you wish to keep to DZAI_settings_override.sqf. Keep this file when upgrading DZAI to newer versions.
- [FIXED] DayZ Epoch: Removed player zombie classnames from AI-usable skin tables to solve loadout issues.
- [FIXED] Dynamic triggers with active spawned AI will not have their locations randomized. Previously, a trigger was considered active if a player was present in the area.
- [UPDATED] AI units spawned with weapongrade = 0 now have a 50% chance of being assigned a pistol or rifle.
- [UPDATED] Static and dynamic AI now share a common Killed eventhandler. This eventhandler decides which action to take when the AI unit is killed (respawn or relocate trigger).
- [UPDATED] AI hands and legs can now be broken in the same way as players. Damage to hands and legs is only applied when sufficient damage has accumulated to cause a fracture.
- [UPDATED] If BIS_fnc_findSafePos can't find a suitable location to spawn/respawn static AI from building positions, exact positions of the buildings will be used instead.
- [UPDATED] Added additional checks to unit loadout function to prevent double primary weapon issue and missing backpack issue. (Needs testing).
- [UPDATED] AI loadout script now checks if skin classname includes weapons and other items (Map, GPS, Compass, Radio, Watch). If any items are present, they are removed. This should help server admins who wish to add custom skin classnames.
- [UPDATED] Updated DZAI installation instructions with a simpler method that should be applicable to most/all DayZ server packages.
- [UPDATED] Respawned AI groups now resume patrolling at a random waypoint instead of starting at the first generated waypoint.
- [MODIFIED] Maximum AI bandages increased to 3 from 2 (maximum self-heals).
- [MODIFIED] Time required for AI self-heal increased to 3.5 seconds from 3 seconds.
- [MODIFIED] Debug markers for ground AI units remain black if unit's weapon or magazine cannot be detected. Once they are detected, the marker turns red (normal case).
- [MODIFIED] Several variables are now attached to the AI group instead of each individual unit.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic AI spawn distance from targeted player increased to 200/300 (min/max) from 150/300 (min/max).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic AI spawn amount equation changed to: (number of players) + (random number 0-2), up to a maximum of 6 AI units.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic AI pursuit distance increased to 300m from 200m.
