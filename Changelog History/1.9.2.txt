- 1.9.2 Update: 

    [CHANGED] Merged core DZAI files for dayz_server and mission pbo versions.
        The missionfile patch is now simply the version.hpp file (installation method remains the same).
    [CHANGED] Added separate function to register bandit kills and humanity (if enabled).
    [CHANGED] Many functions are no longer compiled and loaded if they're not required.
    [CHANGED] Spawn area and spawn location markers are now deleted after they're no longer required (custom AI spawn markers are exempted).
    [CHANGED] Modifications to the radio messaging system:
        If DZAI_findKiller enabled: AI group leaders will broadcast radio text messages to players with radios within a 125m radius.
            These changes will allow nearby players to be aware if a nearby AI group is currently hunting down another player, or allow the target player to know if a pursuing AI group is close. Currently, the Radio provides too easy of a way for players to evade pursuing AI groups by easily knowing their distance.
            Messages will not be broadcasted if group leader is dead or unconscious
            Messages may contain one of the following: target name, target skin, target distance, pursuit end reason (lost contact with target, target killed).
        Dynamic AI pursuit:
            Radio messages will be broadcasted to target player and players within a 50m radius of the target player and received for each player with a radio.
            Radio messages contain same information as findKiller text.
            These changes are intended to improve group gameplay by allowing a nearby friendly player with a radio to warn the group if someone is being pursued by dynamic AI.
            Pursuit messages will not be transmitted if AI group is currently hunting for a player responsible for killing a group member.
        For both:
            Radio messages will only be broadcasted if there are at least 2 live units in the group (a lone AI unit will never transmit radio messages)
    [CHANGED] FindKiller: AI group pursuit range reduced to 300m from 400m.
    [CHANGED] FindKiller: Frequency of player position update lowered to 1 update/20 seconds from 1 update/15 seconds.
    [CHANGED] Dynamic AI will hunt player regardless of what vehicle they're in, but will still not pursue beyond 450m of their spawn location. Frequency of player position update lowered to 1 update/20 seconds from 1 update/15 seconds.
    [CHANGED] Dynamic AI: Frequency of player position update increased to 1 update/25 seconds from 1 update/30 seconds.
    [CHANGED] Minimum number of AI self-heals increased by 1 (maximum is unchanged).
        Weapongrade -1 units will have no self-heals.
    [CHANGED] Significantly lowered AI spotTime ratings (AI will take slightly longer to recognize players as hostile).
    [CHANGED] Very slightly lowered accuracy rating for weapongrade 0 AI units.
    [CHANGED] Updated Chernarus static spawn definitions to new format.
    [CHANGED] Minimum time between each dynamic AI spawn cycle reduced to 5 minutes from 8 minutes. Maximum variance reduced to 3 minutes from 4 minutes.
        New delay range between cycles: 5-8 minutes. Old delay range: 8-12 minutes.
    [CHANGED] Probability limit per dynamic AI spawn increased to 95% from 91%.
    [FIXED] Fixed several bugs related to counting active AI units.
    [FIXED] Using DZAI_setup_AI function to spawn AI units will properly update active AI count
        Note: Using the DZAI_setup_AI function directly is not fully supported, do this at your own risk.
    [FIXED] AI launcher weapons are now properly removed from all AI unit types.
    [FIXED] Support for SMD version of Sahrani map.
    [FIXED] AI helicopter and land vehicle patrols now use the more-efficient method of generating weapongrade values introduced in 1.9.1.
    [FIXED] Abandoned AI helicopters are now properly deleted.
    [FIXED] AI helicopters destroyed over water have crew properly deleted instead of surviving.
    [FIXED] Namalsk: Fixed static AI spawns in north-west Vorkuta.
