1.4.1 Update (Re-release):

- [FIXED] Added an optional experimental fix to prevent AI units from shooting/walking through buildings and objects spawned by DayZ's CfgTownGenerator. Enable by setting DZAI_objPatch = true in dzai_variables.sqf. Enabling this setting may be essential for DayZ Overwatch 0.2.2+.
<b>Note</b>: Enabling DZAI_objPatch *may* cause a flood of "Ref to nonnetwork object" errors in your RPT log. This is a harmless warning message but can be annoying as it fills up the RPT log.
