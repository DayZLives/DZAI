DZAI 1.4.0 Changelog:
============

1. Gameplay Changes
---

- [NEW] Destroying an AI helicopter now causes three dead AI units to be parachuted out. These units carry military-grade gear. (Items are generated using DZAI's highest-tier loot table). Bodies are deleted 10 minutes after they are generated.
- [UPDATED] Changes to AI spawning functions now allow AI units to spawn in tighter quarters (ie: between buildings, inside forests, etc).
- [UPDATED] Collision damage to AI units reduced to 10% to prevent rare cases where AI die after spawning on top of tall objects and die after falling off.
- [UPDATED] Dynamic AI spawn triggers will relocate instead of activating if placed on water.
- [UPDATED] Zombies around AI group leaders are no longer automatically revealed.
- [UPDATED] Increased probability of AI to start self-heal process from 33.3% to 40% (check interval is determined by DZAI_refreshRate).
- [UPDATED] AI helicopters have a 25% chance of entering "Seek and Destroy" mode after reaching a waypoint, where the helicopter will attempt to visually search the area for enemy units (players). S.A.D. mode lasts for 30/60/90 seconds (minimum/average/maximum).
- [UPDATED] Custom static triggers can now have activation delay manually specified. Simply insert an array containing the minimum/average/maximum activation delay. Further instructions are provided in the map config files. (NOTE: This feature is untested. Please report any problems using the DZAI_spawn function).
- [UPDATED] Chernarus: Updated AI spawns for Castle Rog, Devil's Castle, Castle Zub. (AI difficulty/weapon grade, spawn points, patrol radii).
- [UPDATED] Chernarus: Stary Sobor AI spawns changed from 1 group of 2 (+2 max) units of 2 groups of 2 (+1 max) units.
- [UPDATED] Chernarus: Novy Sobor AI spawns changed from 1 (+2 max) units to 2 (+1 max) units. Patrol radius increased from 175m to 225m.
- [FIXED] AI patrol waypoints are no longer generated in water.
- [FIXED] Dynamic AI now properly seeks out targeted player's position beyond the minimum 30 seconds.
- [FIXED] Fixed bugs associated when static triggers have no minimum amount of AI units to spawn or respawn.


2. Under-the-hood Code Changes
----

- [NEW] Debug text in RPT log now reports name of trigger (ie: Electro1, Cherno1) when reporting static trigger activity.
- [UPDATED] Debug markers for helicopters now display text indicating helicopter type and AI group.
- [UPDATED] Updated debug markers for static triggers. Instead of colored circular markers, red/orange/green text will indicate the activity status of the trigger. (Active/Despawning/Inactive). Debug markers for dynamic triggers are unaffected.
- [UPDATED] DZAI_debugMarkers level 2 will allow debug markers for static triggers to refresh periodically (1 refresh/30 seconds). Inactive static triggers will not have their markers refreshed.
- [UPDATED] Modified classname verification script to avoid usage of "call compile...".
- [UPDATED] Reduced building search range for static triggers from 300m to 250, and restricted search criteria to objects of "HouseBase" class instead of "Building".
- [UPDATED] Static triggers now generate a maximum of 100 building positions per trigger. Previously, no limit existed and the number of generated building positions could reach over 500/trigger in dense areas.
- [FIXED] Debug markers for individual AI units and helicopters now check if unit/vehicle is both alive and not null. Should prevent cases where markers remain after the unit/vehicle is destroyed or despawned.
- [FIXED] Fixed rare cases where debug markers for individual AI units and group waypoints were not properly deleted.
