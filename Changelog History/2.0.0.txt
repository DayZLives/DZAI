DZAI 2.0.0 Changelog:
============

    [FIXED] Epoch: Fixed trader menus not appearing. You should not have to resort to using right-click zoom to bring up the trader menus anymore (tested with 100% success rate).
    [FIXED] Epoch: Fixed issue of AI attacking trader units.
    [FIXED] Rewrote dynamic AI despawning procedure to fix an issue where AI would not despawn under certain circumstances.
    [ADDED] Epoch (Napf): Added high-skill AI spawn at Milan military base (weapongrade 3).
	[REMOVED] Epoch: Removed ItemSodaR4z0r from AI loot tables.
	[CHANGED] Epoch (Napf): Moved an AI patrol area away from the Hero Vendor at the southern Airbase.
    [CHANGED] Epoch (Napf): Several minor reductions in AI spawn numbers.
    [CHANGED] DZAI will now default to using Survivor2_DZ as AI skin type if no skin types are available (all user-specified skins are invalid/banned).
    [CHANGED] DZAI will now use all building types as possible spawn points for static AI spawns, as opposed to only buildings that can spawn zombies/loot. Note: Epoch buildables are ignored.
