- 1.9.1 Update: 

	[NEW] Added line-of-sight requirements for AI helicopters to detect players at patrol waypoints
		Players will be able evade detection from AI helicopters by running into buildings or hiding behind large objects.
	[CHANGED] Increased AI helicopter detection radius from 225m/300m to 250m/350m (move waypoint/search-and-destroy waypoint).
	[CHANGED] Lowered reveal level for AI helicopter detection
		Players will be able to escape AI helicopters more easily after being detected (still need to avoid all contact)
	[CHANGED] Large miscellaneous items will only be added to AI backpack if the backpack capacity is 10+ (reduces probability of items "spilling out")
	[CHANGED] Weighted weapongrade probabilities are now calculated during DZAI startup instead of calculated every time a weapongrade value needs to be generated
		Reduces the amount of time/processing needed to spawn AI units considerably
		May increase server startup time slightly (by 0.1 seconds).
	[CHANGED] Added equipType -1 for AI spawned near fresh-spawn locations
		Static spawn locations with equipType -1 will spawn AI that are most likely to be equipped with pistols, and rarely rifles
		Static spawn locations to be edited in a future update
	[CHANGED] Epoch: Dynamic AI spawn blacklist area for trader locations increased from 100m radius to 200m radius
	[CHANGED] Added option to enable or disable DZAI reading from dzai_settings_override.sqf file (default enabled)
	[CHANGED] DZAI will now always try to create the maximum number of possible dynamic AI spawns per 10 minute cycle
		Previously, DZAI only selected 10 random online players, evaluated the necessary conditions, then spawned AI if conditions were met
		Now, DZAI will continue searching until either the maximum number of dynamic spawns is created or all online players have already been evaluated
		Higher-population servers should see an increase in dynamic AI frequency.
	[CHANGED] Updated hacker detection bypass functions.
	[FIXED] Fixed death animation issues with pistol-armed AI units
	[FIXED] Fixed minimum waypoint distance calculation for AI helicopters.
		The distance between current and next waypoint should always be at least 300m.
	[FIXED] DayZ Overwatch mod detection
